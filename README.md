DSA Practice

This repository is a structured collection of solutions to LeetCode problems, solved consistently at a pace of five problems per day.
Each solution is documented with explanations, complexity analysis, and minimal tests to ensure correctness. The goal is to build problem-solving skills in algorithms and data structures while maintaining a transparent record of progress.

Structure

problems/ — one folder per problem containing:

README.md: explanation of the approach, complexity, and pitfalls

solution.py: Python implementation

test_solution.py: basic test cases using pytest

journal/ — daily logs of progress, including solved problems and reflections

JOURNAL.md — high-level weekly summary

scripts/ — automation helpers for scaffolding problems and generating index files

Goals

Build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures

Maintain consistency with daily problem solving

Document approaches to make the learning process reproducible and reviewable

Share progress publicly as part of a long-term portfolio

How to Use

Each problem can be opened independently under problems/

Run tests with:

pytest


Daily progress is logged in the journal/ directory

This tone keeps it:

Professional → no emojis, no informal style

Clear → explains what repo is and why it exists

Reproducible → someone else could use it to follow along
