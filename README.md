# DSA Practice

This repository is a structured collection of solutions to **LeetCode problems**, solved consistently at a pace of five problems per day.  
Each solution is documented with explanations, complexity analysis, and minimal tests to ensure correctness. The purpose of this repository is to build problem-solving skills in algorithms and data structures while maintaining a transparent record of progress.  

## Repository Structure

- `problems/` — one folder per problem containing:
  - `README.md`: explanation of the approach, complexity, and pitfalls  
  - `solution.py`: Python implementation  
  - `test_solution.py`: basic test cases using pytest  
- `journal/` — daily logs of progress, including solved problems and reflections  
- `JOURNAL.md` — high-level weekly summaries  
- `scripts/` — helper scripts for scaffolding new problems and generating the index in the main README  

## Goals

1. Build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures  
2. Maintain consistency with daily problem solving  
3. Document approaches to make the learning process reproducible and reviewable  
4. Share progress publicly as part of a long-term coding portfolio  

## Usage

- Each problem can be explored independently in the `problems/` directory  
- Run test cases with:
  ```bash
  pytest
Daily progress is logged in the journal/ directory
